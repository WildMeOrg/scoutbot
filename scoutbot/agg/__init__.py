"""Aggregation (AGG) returns unified detects for an image given its individual tile detections

This module defines how the tile-base localization detection results are aggregated
at the image level.  This includes the ability to weight the importance of detections
along the border of each tile within an image, and performing non-maximum suppression (NMS)
on the combined results.
